33,2024-10-10,17:20:00, +44 7446 463483," Hi! Some of us attended the f2f meeting last night re the councils ‘engagement exercise’ & here’s some points I took away (sorry for my ramble!) from the rather spicy meeting in case of interest (please feel free to ignore!); * the driver to all of this is that the council want to do all they can to avoid Longhill closing and improve outcomes there. For the 2024 intake 94 places in total were offered. They noted that it’s not feasible to have a secondary school with around this number. They didn’t give a specific number, but capacity at Longhill is 270 per yr and they want to significantly increase children going there. * ⁠they are also keen to ensure greater mixing across the city and provide more choice to children, reduce imbalance of FSM percentages across the schools, and ensure all schools are ‘good’ rating (currently BACA & Longhill are ‘Requires improvement’) * ⁠it seems they will do whatever it takes to ensure they get more kids to Longhill. They seem out of options other than trying to force children from other areas of the city (predominantly ours), by changing catchment areas & reducing places at stringer & varndean. Questions were raised about the very long journeys children would need to make, away from their community, and potentially on their own.. impact on mental health, traffic, environment etc, but it seems this is something that they are willing to push through regardless. They said they’d ‘look into impact at next stage of process’. Also a common response to asking even more children to travel long distances was ‘well some kids are already having to do that’. * ⁠closing Longhill not an option on the table. * ⁠there was a lot of discussion in the group regarding the obvious missing option: to give more support to schools like Longhill that have suffered with low intake: by provisioning more funding and human resources to bring it back up to standard and get it out of ‘requires improvement’, making the school more attractive, to the families in its local community. There was no acknowledgement that this could even be an option. * ⁠they are determined to reduce numbers at varndean & stringer (by 60) because of ‘numbers falling across the city’. This is despite numbers in the stringer / varndean catchment not reducing and both schools being oversubscribed (and this is before the FSM changes come into play). * ⁠very high proportion from our area at the meeting. It seems hove way will be pretty unaffected. * ⁠scrutinising committee has no representation from our area / other areas that will be most impacted by the proposed changes. Seems to predominantly be made up of areas set to gain. * ⁠lack of data / evidence to support any of the 3 options - this was very clear!!! Plans are being rushed through as quickly as possible without the appropriate research being done beforehand. This was a point that was raised time and time again.",[],2898,neutral,0.9875248670578003

147,2024-10-10,18:29:00, +44 7539 488655," Here’s a really helpful write from a friend on the meeting that happened on Tuesday eve…   Hi! Some of us attended the f2f meeting last night re the councils ‘engagement exercise’ & here’s some points I took away (sorry for my ramble!) from the rather spicy meeting in case of interest (please feel free to ignore!); * the driver to all of this is that the council want to do all they can to avoid Longhill closing and improve outcomes there. For the 2024 intake 94 places in total were offered. They noted that it’s not feasible to have a secondary school with around this number. They didn’t give a specific number, but capacity at Longhill is 270 per yr and they want to significantly increase children going there. * ⁠they are also keen to ensure greater mixing across the city and provide more choice to children, reduce imbalance of FSM percentages across the schools, and ensure all schools are ‘good’ rating (currently BACA & Longhill are ‘Requires improvement’) * ⁠it seems they will do whatever it takes to ensure they get more kids to Longhill. They seem out of options other than trying to force children from other areas of the city (predominantly ours), by changing catchment areas & reducing places at stringer & varndean. Questions were raised about the very long journeys children would need to make, away from their community, and potentially on their own.. impact on mental health, traffic, environment etc, but it seems this is something that they are willing to push through regardless. They said they’d ‘look into impact at next stage of process’. Also a common response to asking even more children to travel long distances was ‘well some kids are already having to do that’. * ⁠closing Longhill not an option on the table. * ⁠there was a lot of discussion in the group regarding the obvious missing option: to give more support to schools like Longhill that have suffered with low intake: by provisioning more funding and human resources to bring it back up to standard and get it out of ‘requires improvement’, making the school more attractive, to the families in its local community. There was no acknowledgement that this could even be an option. * ⁠they are determined to reduce numbers at varndean & stringer (by 60) because of ‘numbers falling across the city’. This is despite numbers in the stringer / varndean catchment not reducing and both schools being oversubscribed (and this is before the FSM changes come into play). * ⁠very high proportion from our area at the meeting. It seems hove way will be pretty unaffected. * ⁠scrutinising committee has no representation from our area / other areas that will be most impacted by the proposed changes. Seems to predominantly be made up of areas set to gain. * ⁠lack of data / evidence to support any of the 3 options - this was very clear!!! Plans are being rushed through as quickly as possible without the appropriate research being done beforehand. This was a point that was raised time and time again.",[],2989,neutral,0.997485876083374

It seemed that the Council doesn't yet have consensus on what it wants to do. Councillors raised some issues about travel costs and needing to see what happens with the free school meal policy, and whether there is scope to adjust pupil numbers now and then deal with catchments later. So, I don't think all Councillors want to rush this through. However, I think the Councillor leading it is very eager to push it through and doesn't seem too concerned about how it fits with other priorities. He’s the deputy leader and they have a large majority, so I guess a lot depends on whether other Councillors feel there’s a need to take time to think through alternatives and wider implications. The current proposals are for engagement. If they decide to take it forward, they will need to consult on a proposal, which won't necessarily be the same as the ideas they've put forward so far.",[],1038,neutral,0.998982846736908

He attended Longhill and has said that all his friends went there at the in person meeting apparently!  Council decisions which are tainted by bias may be overturned by the courts. This would be a costly and lengthy process and it would be better to make a complaint at this stage that he is leading the decision making process.  I _think_ the formal process to complain at this point would be to compain that his involvement/ power does not follow the code of conduct for councillors which requires impartiality and complain via the procedure here https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/feedback-about-council-services/complaints-about-councillors …,[],933,negative,0.9963731169700623

So will be very interested to see your analysis Adam when it's done.  It's a very difficult issue especially given the geography of the city (school location and segregation of wealth) but given their proposals could have such implications they need to have the data to show it will achieve what they are saying (which I am not convinced they have).  There is also a lot of discussion on transport and what they could do to try and facilitate this for children.  If you do want to watch the link is here.

435,2024-10-11,08:09:00, +44 7813 923917," Challenging a UK council decision to change the catchment areas for local secondary schools typically involves several steps, focusing on legal procedures, administrative review, and public involvement. Here’s an outline of how you might proceed   1. Engage with the Consultation Process  Before implementing changes to school catchment areas, councils must conduct a public consultation. If you haven’t already, ensure that you have participated in this process:  •	Review the consultation materials provided by the council. •	Submit your objections or concerns during the consultation period, highlighting how the changes will negatively affect your family or the community.  2. Request a Review or Appeal  If the council has made a decision despite objections, you can:  •	Write to the council requesting a formal review of the decision. This may not be a formal appeal, but it is a necessary step in showing your concern. •	Raise the issue with local councillors or MPs, who may advocate on your behalf.  3. Seek a Judicial Review  If the decision-making process was flawed, you might be able to challenge the decision through a judicial review. This is a legal procedure where the High Court reviews the lawfulness of the council’s decision. Grounds for judicial review may include:  •	Procedural unfairness: If the council failed to follow proper procedures during the consultation or decision-making process. •	Illegality: If the council acted outside its powers. •	Irrationality: If the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could have made it.  To pursue judicial review:  •	Act quickly: You must apply within three months of the decision. •	Seek legal advice: Consult a solicitor experienced in public law to determine whether your case has merit.  4. Gather Support from the Community  Organizing a group of concerned parents or local residents can strengthen your case:  •	Petitions or public campaigns: A petition signed by a significant number of affected residents can draw attention to the issue. •	Media coverage: Local press and social media campaigns can put pressure on the council to reconsider.  5. Complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman  If you believe the council has acted unfairly or failed to properly handle the process, you can complain to the Local Government Ombudsman. The Ombudsman investigates complaints about local councils and can make recommendations, although they cannot reverse the decision directly.  6. Alternative Dispute Resolution  You could seek mediation or negotiation with the council, possibly with the help of a mediator, to reach a compromise that better accommodates the concerns of affected parents.  7. Appeal to the Schools Adjudicator  In some cases, especially if the changes are part of a school admissions arrangement, you may be able to appeal to the Schools Adjudicator, an independent body that oversees fair admissions policies. You can challenge the fairness of the catchment changes if they violate the School Admissions Code.  Summary  •	Engage in consultation and seek internal reviews or appeal to councillors or MPs. •	Gather community support and raise public awareness. •	Consider a judicial review if the council’s decision is unlawful or procedurally flawed, with the help of legal advice. •	Explore alternative options, such as complaints to the Ombudsman or the Schools Adjudicator.  Each step will depend on the specific circumstances of the council’s decision, so seeking tailored legal advice is crucial if you’re considering a formal challenge like a judicial review.",[],3574,neutral,0.9957630634307861

There are many children in that catchment that already have to travel 40/50min by bus to get to Longhill. There unfortunately just isn't a good geographical spread of schools across the city. And the impact of shutting Longhill to those children at the expense of potentially no change this side of the city I don't think would be something they would consider. I do think that they need to address the issue of why is it doing so badly. They do have some data on what works and doesn't (on the website) but looks like everything that does would involve money. But potentially instead of thinking about spending money on additional transport they could be spending it on the schools that need it. Excluding the impact of kids from that area going to Lewes Priory seems also to not be addressing the full picture.

They should wait to see if the higher prioritisation of FSM that has recently been changed has any effect on take up. FSM is now 4th priority, after looked after children, EHCP and compelling medical reason. So those kids can now apply to any school they want to. However, schools have limits for the number of FSM they take. Could they not increase these numbers, or have no limit at all? Basically, just wait to see if the desire to go to a school further away is what parents/children actually want?  The council needs to embed and evaluate one policy change before moving onto more drastic solutions. Which in this case is, as a brilliant person above said, ""levelling down, instead of levelling up"".

But lets go through the possible outcomes of the new FSM policy and what they mean.  In the case that not enough children receiving FSM have taken up places to meet the desired threshold, then that won’t change by these proposals. These families can choose where they want to go, regardless of catchment, so they won’t be forced to take spots far from home to support a social agenda. Support for the proposals will only be driven by a desire to give non-FSM parents living in some areas of Brighton more “possibilities” of school (given the oversubscription, its not a “choice”) and to maintain places at Longhill weighed against forcing hundreds of local children near oversubscribed schools out of their communities (with the costs considered elsewhere in discussions).  In the case that all the FSM priority places are taken up this year, then support for the proposals would be from wanting higher than city-average levels of children with FSM at the most successful schools, and support Longhill, weighed against moving hundreds of local children out of their communities (and the mental, social and environmental costs of that).

And people in Whitehawk have been travelling 50 minutes plus for years (sorry I didn't check Adam's map that was just what my friend said). Option B does work for some and gives people in the Varndene baca catchment a lot of choice . There was a comment earlier saying Jacob was sad there wasn't anyone from East Brighton but we know from public involvement in health research priority setting you have to make an effort to include everyone and that would involve spending time encouraging people that their voice was needed and paying for taxis to allow people attend and baby sitters and compensation for time if need be. If you leave it to the people who turn up , they are the well resourced people. The person I spoke to today from Bevendean didn't want to be involved in this group which is fair enough but perhaps an early indicator that a proper engagement exercise needs to be done .

One point in there that I hadn’t seen anyone mention in this chat is the possibility that these changes could push schools to become academies - that is an interesting point.  Does anyone know if any of the schools impacted have commented on these proposed changes, or what their likely positions will be?

Given his history as both a pupil and a governor at Longhill High School (until his recent departure), I question whether he can truly remain impartial.  While his recent resignation as a governor may be seen as an effort to avoid the appearance of bias, his connections to Longhill raise serious concerns that the process could unfairly favor his former school. How can impartiality be assured in such circumstances?  This situation feels like a social experiment, one that punishes areas like Roundhill by uprooting children to attend Cllr Taylor’s school of preference. With such an important issue at stake, the leaders of this review must demonstrate absolute impartiality. If not, the integrity of the entire process will be undermined, reducing it to a sham.  I have written to Cllr Jacob Taylor, urging him to reconsider his involvement in light of these concerns, to help preserve public trust in the process.  “…You just noticed that your classmates from Longhill weren’t really coming with you in the same way that those from Stringer and Varndean were, and that’s no comment on Longhill as a school, which I love and care for and support.” (Cllr Jacob Taylor, 6.11.23)",[],1332,negative,0.9968706965446472

I'm pretty mad that social mix and educational attainment have been weaponised in this way and the council have tried to pull the wool over the eyes of everyone with the way this has been presented.  I agree that there are very serious questions to ask about the clear conflict of interest between someone with personal and deep connections to Longhill running this whole process. This has a real whiff of private eye's ""Rotten Boroughs"" column about it.  I've got loads more evidence to produce, but the way that the council have tried to hide the evidence from us and it wouldn't have come out at all unless I'd busted a gut to do it, shows that this whole thing stinks to high heaven.  And that they'd consider wrecking that daily lives of kids in the city who'd have to travel for miles and hours just so that they can fudge the finances for a school that's in long term demographically and geographically induced population decline (this is much bigger than a single ofsted report although that won't help the situation any) is rage inducing.

Disadvantaged children in B&H are already above catchment area as a priority. This is about reducing the number of children in innercity schools to increase the number of children in what is essentially a village outside by busing innercity children out. Therefore increasing the money that school receives at the expense of more popular inner city schools. Personally I have every sympathy for those children in Whitehawk been forced to school outside of their city and they should be moved into a catchment area for city schools by keeping the city school PANs inline with demand. And Longhill’s identity being a school to serve the village communities as it traditionally was and making it heart of its community.

Even though their own expert, Dr. Greaves has recommended to wait and see what the impact of the FSM policy is before changing catchment areas?! (I don’t doubt it, but it would be useful to be able to point to in order to demonstrate his bias). I think this just further demonstrates how flawed and prejudiced the whole process is.  Hugely frustrating.  As noted above, a lot is already being done, so adding another change which has obvious an obvious big environmental and social downside before knowing the impact of the changes already in motion is surely a bad idea.  I agree with the sentiment above that the key argument against these changes is the  need to wait and see the impact of the change in admissions policy relating to FSM recipients and the impact of changes made by the new head at Longhill (which apparently Cllr Taylor commented he was certain would have a big impact, or words to that effect). I think the other key argument against is around the fact that the available options have been reduced to 3 _before_ any explicit consideration of the environmental, social and economic impacts of children travelling much further away to school. Those considerations should clearly be central to the process from the beginning, long before there are only 3 options on the table. <This message was edited>",[],1429,negative,0.9989058971405029

Just want to send my two cents for the working group   I believe the council would have been well aware prior to releasing this that there was going to be massive push back from our community (of course there is, there is only downside for us) and would have made a judgement that they’ll be able to garner enough support from the communities that ‘benefit’ to make a case that the majority of the city supports these proposals.  I may be cynical but i am unsure whether us making  our arguments (albeit very valid and coordinated ones) will be enough to influence their decision making on this. I believe our best chances of getting them to rethink is to understand what legal arguments we may have. I  remember the council tried to make very similar changes 10+ years ago and the impacted parents (I believe with legal assistance) were able to stop it happening. I was an uninterested teenager at the time so I don’t have any further details! But worth investigating how this was successfully stopped and what arguments were used.  I am sure this is the case for most here but want to make clear that my desire to stop this isn’t driven by a lack of care for the deprived children in our city; their school commutes and options are a disgrace. It’s driven by my belief that this policy will do little to help these children and will effectively be ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ by making the long commutes and forced attendance to a currently underperforming school a problem for our children instead.

Especially as, despite been based on FSM it’s hard to see how it actually benefits children on FSMs (as they are already a higher priority than catchment area) As he failed to disclose he was governor there is no doubt he has concealed potential bias in his decision making. This is against Councillors and Labour Party codes of conduct . If everyone who honestly believes these codes have been broken I believe they a moral/ethical and civic duty to makes a complaint about this conflict of interests and requests clarification why all other options have been excluded - (different catchment areas/different PANs / alternate models feeder schools which mix affluence areas but still feed secondary school’s geographically located/etc… )if the council and the Labour Party revive hundreds of complains and don’t take action this would look damming.

A conflict of interest is a defined term under regulations and local government guidance and I cannot see that it applies here. However the guidance also includes the issue of 'bias' which refers to ""the appearance or risk of bias rather than bias in fact"". A challenge on this basis may be more successful? The guidance refers to the possibility that such bias may suggest that the outcome of a decision is predetermined which seems to be a concern here. However these things are usually only considered at the point a decision is made, where the conflicted person is asked to leave the room or abstain from a vote so they could argue that this doesn't have to be considered yet as they are just in a pre-consultation phase.

They’ve got a 5 day turn around on these requests so I probably won’t have it until next week. It will be good to see what their assessment covers.

Some of the rhetoric that has come from Class Divide has been very divisive  ‘Middle Class playing the long game’ etc..  Whilst they have shone a light on issues many of us were not aware of.

I.e. unwilling to change anything. Isn't it more that change can be considered to make the system fairer but that extremely long journeys are very hard on kids, and the potential journeys created by option B would be longer than any currently in the city, involving large numbers of kids and causing lots of other problems for the transport system/kids with SEN etc. <This message was edited>",[],526,negative,0.9980360865592957
